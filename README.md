# Niobium

## What is Niobium?

**Niobium** is a Vanilla+ Mod that adds new features and performance improvements to the game. Currently, Niobium is only available on Modrinth, since it's the best place to publish a mod. However, this can change in the future.

## Installation Guide

In the current state of the mod, Niobium is only available for Fabric. If you are using a third-party launcher, it probably has built-in functionality to automatically install mod loaders. Once you have installed your mod loader, simply place Niobium into your mods folder.

## Features

- New **Endrite Ore**. Can be found in The End and can be used in Smithing Tables along with the new Endrite Smithing Templates to create the new Endrite armor and tools set.
- New wood variants.
- New stairs/slabs variants of blocks.
- New crops.
